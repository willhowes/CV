## Will Howes

I am a full-stack developer with a passion for writing clean and readable code. I am a friendly and hard-working team player looking for my first role as a junior developer. Having recently embarked on the 12-week intensive bootcamp with [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), I am quickly progressing from an enthusiastic coder who does a bit in his spare time to a confident and highly competent software developer. I hope to joing a team that is equally as enthusiastic about coding as me and with whom I can continue to develop my skills. 

## Skills

#### Communication

Working as a client-facing property lawyer, I have proven myself to be an excellent and efficient commincator.  

- I would regularly be on the phone, emailing and meeting face-to-face with my clients, estate agents and other relevant parties in order that everyone is kept informed on the progress of a transaction and what the next steps are. 
- Clients would be given feedback forms at the end of a transaction. My communication skills were often highly praised.
- Colleagues who had referred to me long-standing clients, sometimes with very high exectations, would feedback to me how highly those clients thought of me.

#### Problem Solving
As a property lawyer I would off come up against particular technical and logistical challenges, particularly when up against a tight timeframs. I am adept at using logical reasoning to come up with possible solutions to such challenges.

- When dealing with a property transaction, potential road blocks are sometimes met which could jeapardise meeting of deadlines or even the transaction altogether. By tackling the issue head on and assessing possible solutions, I would advise clients and other stakeholders succinctly so that as little time is wasted as possible.
- Clients have thanked me for being honest in my assessment of difficult situations and finding possible solutions.

#### Team Work
Thoughout my life, both in work and outside of work I have been a team-player, keen to help others and do what is best for the collective rather than just myself. 

- As a Licensed Conveyancer I have been effective in collaborating with colleagues to manage workloads, improve practices, share knowledge and resolve challenging technical issues.
- As an example, in previous roles I have led my team's CPD direction to ensure my colleagues could easily and effectively keep up-to-date with their professional development. I have also often led the way to bring in standard procedures and policies to make the team more efficient. 
- Colleagues would often show their gratitude for my efforts to put in the extra work to help the running of the team. 

#### Handling pressure
I have a calmness under pressure which means I can be clear in my decision making and reassure others in challenging time-sensitive situations. 

- As anyone who has bought or sold a property knows, particularly, the process can be extremely stressful. Everyday as a property lawyer I would be challenged with urgent tasks. 
- By prioritising my workload, keeping calm and working through tasks methodically I am able to work efficiently and meet the expectations of client and other stakeholders. 
- Clients and other stakeholders have regularly commented on times where a transaction became particularly stressful for them but my calmness and reassurance helped them through.
