## Profile
I am a Software Developer, recently graduated from Makers Academy, actively looking for new work opportunities.

In recent years, I revisited my childhood hobby of computer programming through adult education courses, online tutorials and various books. Having rekindled my love of coding, this June after careful consideration, I left my previous career as a Licensed Conveyancer and embarked on the 12-week coding bootcamp at Makers. I have progressed from an enthusiastic amateur coder to a confident and competent software developer. The journey has been fun and rewarding. I am looking forward to combining my existing work experience with my new-found skills and continuing to learn in my first role as a developer and beyond.

## Skills

#### Building software
The examples above show projects I have built on my own and in teams. I write clean and readable code so that other developers can understand my code quickly.

#### Quick Learner
One of many reasons I was attracted to a career as a developer is the ever-changing nature of technology, which means I will always be learning something new. At Makers Academy, I have honed my self-led learning approach to become highly effective at setting my learning goals, researching for learning materials and monitoring my progress.

#### Team Work and Communication
At Makers I have learned and used agile working tools such as stand-ups, retros and sprints. I make valuable contributions to the teams I work in by actively engaging in these practices, and using the excellent communication skills I have developed throughout my previous career.  

#### Technologies I have used
| Lanuages        | Frameworks and other technologies          | Testing Frameworks  | Processes |
| ------------- |-------------| -----| -----|
