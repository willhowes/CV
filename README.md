## Profile
Over the past few years, I have revisited my childhood hobby of computer programming through adult education courses, online tutorials and a number of books. This June, having rekindled my love of coding, and after a lot of research and careful consideration, I left my previous career as a Licenced Conveyancer and embarked on a 12-week coding bootcamp at Makers Academy. During this time I have progressed from an enthusiastic amateur coder to a confident and highly competent software developer. The journey has been fun and rewarding. I am looking forward to continuing to learn in my first role as a developer and beyond.

## Skills

#### Building software
The example projects above from the repositories on my Github profile, show projects I have built on my own and in teams. I write clean code and readable code so that other developers I work with are able to read and understand my code quickly.

#### Quick Learner
One of many reasons I was attracted to a career as a developer is the ever-changing nature of technology, which means I will always be learning something new. At Makers Academy, I have honed my self-led learning to become highly effective at setting my learning goals, researching for learning materials and monitoring my progress.

#### Team Work and Communication
At Makers we have learned and practiced agile working tools such as stand-ups, retros and sprints. By encouraging the use of these practices, together with using my coding and communication skills, I make valuable contributions to the teams I work in.  

#### Technologies I have used
| Lanuages        | Frameworks and other technologies          | Testing Frameworks  | Processes |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:|
