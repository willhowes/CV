## Will Howes

I am a full-stack developer with a passion for writing clean and readable code. Having recently embarked on the 12-week intensive boot camp with [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), I am quickly progressing from an enthusiastic amateur coder to a confident and highly competent software developer. I am a friendly and hard-working team player looking for my first role as a junior developer. I hope to join a team that is enthusiastic about coding and with whom I can continue to develop my skills. 

## Skills

#### Communication

Working as a client-facing property lawyer, I have proven myself to be an excellent and efficient communicator.  

- My working day would involve regularly being on the phone, emailing and meeting face-to-face with clients, estate agents and other parties making sure everyone is kept informed on the progress of a transaction and what the next steps are. 
- Clients would be given feedback forms at the end of a transaction and my communication skills were often highly praised.
- Colleagues who had referred to me long-standing clients, sometimes with very high expectations, would feedback to me how highly those clients thought of me.

#### Problem Solving
As a property lawyer I would off come up against a range of technical and logistical challenges. I am adept at using logical reasoning to come up with possible solutions to such challenges.

- When dealing with a property transaction, potential roadblocks are sometimes met which could jeopardise meeting of deadlines or even the transaction altogether. By tackling the issue head-on and assessing possible solutions, I would advise clients and other stakeholders succinctly so that as little time is wasted as possible.
- Clients have thanked me for being honest in my assessment of difficult situations and finding solutions.

#### Team Work
Throughout my life, both in work and outside of work I have been a team player. I am keen to help others and do what is best for the collective rather than just myself. 

- As a Licensed Conveyancer, I have been effective in collaborating with colleagues to manage the team's workloads, improve practices, share knowledge and resolve difficult technical issues.
- As an example, in previous roles, I have led my team's CPD direction to ensure my colleagues could easily and effectively keep up-to-date with their professional development. I have also often led the way to bring in standard procedures and policies to make the team more efficient. 
- Colleagues would often show their gratitude for my efforts to put in the extra work to help the running of the team. 

#### Handling pressure
I have a calmness under pressure, enabling me to be clear in my decision making and reassure others in challenging time-sensitive situations. 

- As anyone who has bought or sold a property knows, the process can be extremely stressful. Every day as a property lawyer I would be challenged with multiple urgent tasks. 
- By prioritising my workload, keeping calm and working through tasks methodically I can work efficiently and meet the expectations of the client and other stakeholders. 
- Clients have regularly commented that my calmness and reassurance helped them through times where a transaction became particularly stressful for them.
