# Will Howes
**Full Stack Developer**

## Profile
[My blog on Medium](https://medium.com/@williameldenhowes)

Having rekindled my love of coding in the last few years, I recently took a leap of faith by leaving my previous career as a Licenced Conveyancer and embarked on a 12-week bootcamp at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). At Makers, I have progressed quickly from an enthusiastic amateur coder to a confident and highly competent software developer. I write clean and readable code and make valuable contributions to the teams I work with. I have demonstrated at Makers and in my previous career to be friendly and hard-working team-player with excellent communication skills. I am looking for my first role as a junior developer and I am excited to join a team enthusiastic about coding and with whom I can continue to develop my skills.

## Skills as a Full Stack Developer
These are some of the skills I have gained as a developer from self-learning and attending Makers Academy. 

##### I can make software
At Makers I have proved I can make software, from scratch if necessary, using test-driven development. This can be seen from the projects in my Github Repository which I have built on my own and in teams.

* An example of a group project I was a part of ['Angels - a Facebook copy'](https://github.com/Kaymo1990/acebook---CharliesAngels)
* An example of a solo project: ['Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/willhowes/bowling-challenge)

When building projects on my own or in teams, I take a methodical approach to solving problems. I do rush into writing code before carrying out any necessary planning and writing relevant tests. If bugs are found, I can calmly locate the issue by understanding the error messages and using tools such as pausing the code where the issue lies and printing the output of the relevant code statements. 

I understand the importance of having clean and readable code. I make sure I refactor frequently so that another developer will be able to look at my code and understand it quickly.

##### I'm equipped for long term growth

I love learning which is one of many reasons why I was so attracted to a career as a developer. 

In week 5 of the course at Makers, having had only a very basic grasp of Javascript previously, I was able to become competent in testing in Javascript in just a few days with little guidance from the coaches. In the same week, I learned how test drive in Python in a matter of hours. This shows I can learn quickly and effectively by myself. 

##### I help my teams succeed

Not long ago I had only a very basic understanding of agile working. Now, this has become almost second nature to me, as we have used agile working tools in our group work at Makers. I understand the benefits that tools such as stand-ups, retros and sprints have on improving a team's communicate and focus on goals. 

When I have worked in teams, and particularly when pair programming, I will always communicate what the code I am writing is for. This means that other team members can understand the code I have written and easily implement changes where necessary.  

Whilst I believe I can learn new technologies and programming concepts very quickly, here are come of the languages, frameworks and concepts I have used frequently as a developer: Object Orientated Programming, Test Driven Development, the Model-View-Controller pattern, Domain Modelling, Ruby, Ruby-on-Rails, Rspec, Capybara, Python, Javascript, Jasmine, jQuery, Ajax requests, HTML, CSS, Sinatra, Github, Heroku, Travis CI. 

## Transferable Skills from my previous career

#### Communication

Working as a client-facing property lawyer, I have proven myself to be an excellent and efficient communicator.  

- My working day would involve regularly being on the phone, emailing and meeting face-to-face with clients, estate agents and other parties making sure everyone is kept informed on the progress of a transaction and what the next steps are. 
- Clients would be given feedback forms at the end of a transaction and my communication skills were often highly praised.
- Colleagues who had referred to me long-standing clients, sometimes with very high expectations, would feedback to me how highly those clients thought of me.

#### Problem Solving
As a property lawyer, I would off come up against a range of technical and logistical challenges. I am adept at using logical reasoning to come up with possible solutions to such challenges.

- When dealing with a property transaction, potential roadblocks are sometimes met which could jeopardise meeting of deadlines or even the transaction altogether. By tackling the issue head-on and assessing possible solutions, I would advise clients and other stakeholders succinctly so that as little time is wasted as possible.
- Clients have thanked me for being honest in my assessment of difficult situations and finding solutions.

#### Team Work
Throughout my life, both in work and outside of work I have been a team player. I am keen to help others and do what is best for the collective rather than just myself. 

- As a Licensed Conveyancer, I have been effective in collaborating with colleagues to manage the team's workloads, improve practices, share knowledge and resolve difficult technical issues.
- As an example, in previous roles, I have led my team's CPD direction to ensure my colleagues could easily and effectively keep up-to-date with their professional development. I have also often led the way to bring in standard procedures and policies to make the team more efficient. 
- Colleagues would often show their gratitude for my efforts to put in the extra work to help the running of the team. 

#### Handling pressure
I have a calmness under pressure, enabling me to be clear in my decision making and reassure others in challenging time-sensitive situations. 

- As anyone who has bought or sold a property knows, the process can be extremely stressful. Every day as a property lawyer I would be challenged with multiple urgent tasks. 
- By prioritising my workload, keeping calm and working through tasks methodically I can work efficiently and meet the expectations of the client and other stakeholders. 
- Clients have regularly commented that my calmness and reassurance helped them through times where a transaction became particularly stressful for them.


## Education

#### Makers Academy (June-Sept 2019)

Attending Makers Academy has been an incredible experience. As well as being great fun, it has proved to me what you can achieve in a short space of time with focused and goal-orientated learning. During the course, my coding skills have been transformed. For example, at the start of the course I barely knew what Test-Driven Development ('TDD') was, now I consider myself to competent at test driving to build any program. The benefit of attending Makers Academy go beyond coding. I have improved my communication skills which have made me a more effective pair programmer and team-player. At Makers Academy you are encouraged to self-learn and set your own goals. Since the start of the course, I have become highly effective at setting my learning goals, researching for learning materials and monitoring my progress. With these skills in place, I am very well equipped to learn new languages, frameworks and technologies in the fast-moving tech industry.
