## Your Name

I am a friendly and hard-working team player with a passion for writing clean and readable code. I am currently on a 12-week intensive bootcamp with Makers Academy, making the transformation from an enthusiastic amateur coder to a confident and highly competent software developer. I am looking for my first role as a junior developer working in a team equally enthusiastic about coding and with whom I can continue to develop my skills.
