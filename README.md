## Profile
Over the past few years, I have revisited my childhood hobby of computer programming through adult education courses, online tutorials and a number of books. Having rekindled my love of coding, in June I took a leap of faith, leaving my previous career as a Licenced Conveyancer and embarking on a 12-week coding bootcamp at Makers Academy. During this time I have progressed from an enthusiastic amateur coder to a confident and highly competent software developer. The journey has been fun and rewarding. I am looking forward to continuing to learn in my first role as a developer and beyond.

I am looking for my first role as a junior developer and am excited to join a team enthusiastic about coding and with whom I can continue to develop my skills.

## Skills as a Full Stack Developer
Below are some of the skills I have gained as a developer from attending Makers Academy, online and adult education courses, and self-led learning. 

#### I can make software
Through attending the course at Makers, I have proven I can build software, from scratch if necessary, using test-driven development. The examples [projects]() below from the repositories on my Github profile, show projects I have built on my own and in teams. Please note that, due to the fast-paced nature of learning at Makers Academy, some of the projects are partially complete.  

When building projects on my own or in teams, I take a methodical approach to solving problems. Before jumping into the code, I take time to plan and write a suitable first test. If bugs are found, I can locate the issue by reading and understanding the error messages and using tools such as pausing the running of the code and printing the output of relevant statements. 

I understand the importance of having clean and readable code. When taking part in group work at Makers, we frequently change pair partners and roles so each team member has exposure to every part of the code. Because I refactor my code frequently, other developers in the team have been able to read and understand my code quickly.


#### I am equipped for long term growth
One of many reasons I was attracted to a career as a developer is the ever-changing nature of technology, which means I will always be learning something new. At Makers Academy you are encouraged to take control of your learning and set your own goals. I have honed my self-led learning to become highly effective at setting my learning goals, researching for learning materials and monitoring my progress. With these skills in place, I am well equipped to learn new languages, frameworks and technologies in the fast-moving digital sector. 
  
By applying this focused and goal-orientated learning, I have achieved a great deal in a short space of time at Makers. During the course, my coding skills have been transformed. For example, at the start of the course I barely knew what Test-Driven Development ('TDD') was; I now consider myself to be competent at test driving to build any program. 

In week 5 of the course at Makers, having had only a very basic grasp of Javascript previously, I was able to become competent in testing in Javascript in just a few days with little guidance from the coaches. In the same week, I learned how to test drive in Python in a matter of hours. This shows I can learn quickly and effectively by myself. 

#### I help my teams succeed
At Makers we have learned and practiced agile working tools such as stand-ups, retros and sprints. By encouraging the use of these practices, together with using my coding and communication skills, I make valuable contributions to the teams I work in. 

When planning, pair programming or mob-programming in teams, I will communicate clearly. This means that other team members can easily understand the reasoning behind my contributions to planning and the code itself.  


#### Technologies I have regularly used
I can learn new technologies and programming concepts quickly. Some of the languages, frameworks, tools and concepts I have learned in the relatively short time I have been coding include: Object Orientated Programming, Test Driven Development, the Model-View-Controller pattern, Domain Modelling, Ruby, Ruby-on-Rails, Rspec, Capybara, Python, Javascript, Jasmine, jQuery, Ajax requests, HTML, CSS, Sinatra, Postgres, SQL, Github, Heroku, Travis CI.

## Transferable Skills from my previous career as a Licensed Conveyancer

#### Communication
Working as a client-facing property lawyer, I have proven myself to be an excellent and efficient communicator.  

I regularly communicated with clients, estate agents and other parties by phone, email and face-to-face meetings. Using clear and effective communication, I ensured that relevant parties were kept informed on the progress of a transaction and the next steps. When giving feedback at the end of a transaction, clients often praised my communication skills. 

#### Problem Solving
As a property lawyer, I would often come up against a range of technical and logistical problems. I often relied on my logical reasoning skills to find solutions to such challenges.

Property transactions frequently present roadblocks, which can jeopardise meeting a client's expectations. I tackled such issues head-on, assessed possible solutions, before advising clients and other stakeholders succinctly. Many of my clients have thanked me for my honest assessment of difficult situations and finding solutions.

#### Team Work
Throughout my life, both in work and outside of work I have been a team player. I am keen to help others and do what is best for the collective rather than just myself. 

As a Licensed Conveyancer, I collaborated with colleagues to manage the team's workloads, improve practices, share knowledge and resolve difficult technical issues. In previous roles, I have been responsible for leading the professional development of my colleagues, ensuring they stayed up-to-date with their knowledge and skills. I also implemented standard procedures and policies to make the team more efficient. 

#### Handling pressure
I remain calm under pressure, enabling me to be clear in my decision-making and reassure others in challenging, time-sensitive situations. 

Every day as a property lawyer I would be challenged with multiple urgent tasks. By prioritising my workload, keeping calm and working through tasks methodically I can work efficiently and meet the expectations of the client and other stakeholders. Clients have regularly commented that my calmness and reassurance helped them through times where a transaction became particularly stressful for them.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (June-Sept 2019)

Attending Makers Academy has been an incredible experience. As well as being great fun, it has proved to me what you can achieve in a short space of time with focused and goal-orientated learning. During the course, my coding skills have been transformed. For example, at the start of the course I barely knew what Test-Driven Development ('TDD') was, now I consider myself to competent at test driving to build any program. The benefit of attending Makers Academy go beyond coding. I have improved my communication skills which have made me a more effective pair programmer and team-player. At Makers Academy you are encouraged to self-learn and set your own goals. Since the start of the course, I have become highly effective at setting learning goals, researching and studying suitable materials and putting what I have learned into practice. I have also kept track of my progress with a [learning portfolio](https://github.com/willhowes/makers_portfolio_and_notes). With these skills in place, I am very well equipped to learn new languages, frameworks and technologies in the fast-moving tech industry.
